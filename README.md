# Simulation of Balls Bouncing In A Box
Originally this was an end of module project for an introduction to object oriented C++ taken in my third year of my Physics degree. 

## Description:
The simulation allows for you to add many balls inside a container that will then interact with each other and bounce around. You can quite easily imagine this as a simplistic simulation of molecules in an ideal gas. To further demonstrate my understanding of inheritance and polymorphism, I also included the option to add balls with different mechanics such as an electric charge or allowing them to interact based on the gravitational forces. 


## Tasks:
While I currently have a working simulation, I would like to rebuild this from scratch to remind myself further about the concepts (in particular of polymorphism). Also as I know have been writing C++ code for another 4 years, I am hoping to improve upon the simulation and write the code in a more efficient manner. Once I have a working example again, I will start looking into creating an executable file such that the project can be run without having to build the code manually.
